```
```sh
sudo python MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py
```

### 4. Verify the device is now associated with your organization and itâ€™s healthy.
```sh
mdatp health
```

wget --quiet -O XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip  https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzer
```
```sh
unzip -q XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip
```

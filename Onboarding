# Onboarding to MDE

## Onboarding Linux VM using local script

### 1. Download the onboarding package from [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](security.microsoft.com)to the Linux machine you want to onboard.

### 2. Extract the contents of the archive.
```sh
unzip WindowsDefenderATPOnboardingPackage.zip
```

### 3. Navigate to the path where the script locates and run the onboarding script.
```sh
cd <path of the script>
```
```sh
sudo python MicrosoftDefenderATPOnboardingLinuxServer.py
```

### 4. Verify the device is now associated with your organization and itâ€™s healthy.
```sh
mdatp health
```

### 5. If this device stays unhealthy after the onboarding, please collect the XMDEClientAnalyzer results:
```sh
wget --quiet -O XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip  https://aka.ms/XMDEClientAnalyzer
```
```sh
unzip -q XMDEClientAnalyzer.zip
```
```sh
cd XMDEClientAnalyzer
```
````sh
chmod +x mde_support_tool.sh
